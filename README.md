# Wizard Vs Dragon: a work in progress

This project uses CSS for style and JavaScript and jQuery for functionality. At the moment, there are two events. On the landing page, the user is requested to enter the Konami code (up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, b, a, enter). The user is rewarded with a success sound and screen change, or prompted with a fail notice to try again.

jQuery functions then change the screen to a fantasy scene with a wizard and a dragon. The characters are able to move right and left with .animate. Instructions for movement appear at the top of the screen.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1.) Enter the Konami code (see above) on the landing page.

2.) On the next screen, a-d moves the wizard left-right.

3.) j-l moves the dragon left-right.

4.) Future abilities pending.
